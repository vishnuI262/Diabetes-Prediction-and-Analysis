# Diabetes Prediction and Analysis

This project focuses on predicting diabetes and analyzing factors related to diabetes readmission using machine learning and data analysis techniques.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:

**Part 1: Diabetes Prediction**

- Uses a KNN approach to impute missing values in the dataset.
- Preprocesses the data by encoding the output and standardizing input features.
- Trains a logistic regression model to predict diabetes.
- Evaluates the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC curve.

**Part 2: Diabetes Readmission Analysis**

- Explores the relationship between HbA1c levels, medication changes, and readmission rates.
- Analyzes the impact of measuring HbA1c on medication changes and readmissions.
- Investigates the relationship between HbA1c, primary diagnosis, and readmission.
- Visualizes the findings using heatmaps and clustered bar plots.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the "Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008" dataset available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information on over 100,000 hospital admissions for diabetic patients.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, requests, zipfile, io

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the code and view the results.

## Results

The project provides insights into the factors that influence diabetes prediction and readmission rates. The findings can be used to improve patient care and reduce the risk of readmission.
